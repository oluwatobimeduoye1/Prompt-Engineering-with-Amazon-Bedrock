# Prompt-Engineering-with-Amazon-Bedrock
This project showcases how to build and deploy a generative AI-powered web application where users interact with large language models (LLMs) hosted on Amazon Bedrock through a serverless backend. It demonstrates end-to-end implementation, from infrastructure setup to prompt optimization using SageMaker Studio notebooks.
